# JavaScript-Practice-question2

Problem statement 1
Given an unsorted array of numbers and another number, you are required to find the index at which the number would be placed if it were to be inserted in a sorted version of the array of numbers.

Note: The purpose of this exercise is to help you practice arrow functions.

The function getIndex has already been defined for you. However, for this exercise, re-write the declaration of getIndex using arrow functions and use them in its implementation as well.

Input #
An array and a number to be inserted

Output #
Lowest index at which the number should be inserted

Sample input #
([5,4,1,3],2)
Sample output #
1
Challenge #
Take a close look and design a step-by-step algorithm before jumping on to the implementation. This problem is designed for your practice, so try to solve it on your own first. If you get stuck, you can always refer to the solution provided. Good luck!

 

 

 

 
Problem statement 2
Study the code on line 2 in the testing widget carefully.

const exampleObject = {collection: [{name: "Kelly",}, {name: "Anna",}],}
Your task is to use destructuring to extract and display the name of the second object in the array.

Input #
An array of objects

Output #
Name of the second object

Sample input #
[{name: "Kelly",}, {name: "Anna",}]
Sample output #
"Anna"

Problem statement 3
Study the code given below and then run it.

                                                               

 

function·Human(name,·age)·{

····this.name·= name;

    this.age = age;

};

function Man(name) {

};

function check(){

    var obj = new Man("Tommy Tan");

    console.log(obj.name) 

    console.log(obj instanceof Human) 

}

check()

It displays undefined and false as the results from lines 11-12. Your task is to implement inheritance between the class Human and Man. In the end, the code should compile successfully and give the correct output. Do this in the testing widget at the end.

Input #
Incomplete Sample Code

Output #
Code implementing inheritance and giving the correct output
